# Ggen (HTML Abstraction Markup Language)

Ggen is a AVP game generator that's used to read game information from options
and paytables, then generate a basic AVP game based on another reference game.
Ggen is designed to be a replacement for many manual work to start up a new game,
such as, changing game id, merging resources, tuning symbol configuration scripts,
correcting configuration files and etc.

However, Ggen is 'not' a complete solution of developing a new AVP game. It only
serve the programers to free them from repitition and not-so-creative work on the
start up. For other complex features, you are on your own.

## Features

* Changing a reference game's game id

* Parse paytables.
* Generate Symbols related scripts.
* Generate stage configurations and optional stages like 'rmlp.
